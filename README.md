# Azure Cognitive Services Translation demo

from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/quickstart-translator?tabs=python):

Try the latest version of Azure Translator. In this quickstart, you'll get started using the Translator service to translate text using a programming language of your choice or the REST API. For this project, we recommend using the free pricing tier (F0), while you're learning the technology, and later upgrading to a paid tier for production.
